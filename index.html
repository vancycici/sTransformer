<div><b>Abstract:</b> Neural end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) , which adopts either a recurrent model, e.g. Tacotron, or an attention one, e.g. Transformer, to characterize a speech utterance, has achieved significant improvement of speech synthesis. However, it is still very challenging to deal with different sentence lengths, particularly, for long sentences where sequence model has limitation of the effective context length. We propose a novel segment-Transformer (s-Transformer), which models speech at segment level where recurrence is reused via cached memories for both the encoder and decoder. Long-range contexts can be captured by the extended memory, meanwhile, the encoder-decoder attention on segment which is much easier to handle. In addition, we employ a modified relative positional self attention to generalize sequence length beyond a period possibly unseen in the training data. By comparing the proposed s-Transformer with the standard Transformer, on short sentences, both achieve the same MOS scores of 4.29, which is very close to 4.32 by the recordings; similar scores of 4.22 vs 4.2 on long sentences, and significantly better for extra-long sentences with a gain of 0.2 in MOS. Since the cached memory is updated with time, the s-Transformer generates rather natural and coherent speech for a long period of time.

        “Byron was a notorious rule breaker in his personal life, but he was also a stickler for rhyme and metre. In his poem, When We Two Parted, for example, Byron writes about forbidden love, a love that broke the rules, but does do so by precisely following some well-established poetic laws. And many would argue it is all the more powerful for it.”

        “Beyond the newspapers and magazines and an occasional novel of the hour, idly taken up and indifferently put aside, it has no literary needs. With this listless multitude we have not to concern ourselves, but rather with  that sufficiently heterogeneous body known as the reading public, the people for whom Mr. Carnegie builds libraries, and the publishers display their wares. Of course, among these there must necessarily be a considerable percentage temperamentally unappreciative of poetry, — just as there are numbers of people born with no ear for music, and numbers, again, born with no color-sense. The lover of poetry is no less born than the poet himself. Yet, as the poet is made as well as born, so is his reader; and there are many who really love poetry without knowing it, but who think they do not care for it, — either because they have contracted a wrong notion of what poetry is, or because they have some time or other made a bad start with the wrong kind.”
